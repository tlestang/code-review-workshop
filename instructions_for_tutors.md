# Intrustion for tutors of Code Review Workshop

In the hands-on session you will be working with a group of 8 - 10 people.
Here's what you need to do:

1) Create a fork of this repository.
2) Identify a code snippet that you want to discuss with your group. The snippets are
   described in `README.md` file and they are all located at different branch (`git branch -a`).
   (**HINT** try to pick snippets with the programming language most people are comfortable with, but you can also suggest one with the other language)
2) In GitHub create a new pull request with a number of the group and snippet name, i.e. "Room 1: apply_vaccine.R". **PR should go from your personal repo branch to the `main` branch of this upstream) repo**. 
4) Distribute the link to the PR with the members of the group.
5) Give people 10-15 minutes to perform a review on their own. It can be by adding comments
    straight to GotHub PR, or just making notes.
5) After that time, encourage people to discuss the key points of the code (some of
   the code smells were desribed in the `README.md` to help you get started).
6) Remember also to mention about the positives of the code.
7) Pay attention to the way that people phrase their feedback: they should be respectful, specific,
   non-opininated, etc.
8) Repeat 3-4 times.
